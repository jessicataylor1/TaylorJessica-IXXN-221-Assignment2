            <h2>About</h2> 
            <p>I'm a second year design innovation student at Victoria University of Wellington. I'm majoring in Interaction Design and minoring in 
                Communications Design. I didn't always see myself going into design but in my last year of high school 
                I made the decision to come to Victoria's School of Design and am happy with what I decision. The Design inovation program has allowed me to explore other aspects of design and helped develop my skill further.
                 Interaction design has made me aware that it's not only about creating apps and webpages, its also how a user interacts with a certian object. After university I plan to move to
                Christchurch and hopefully get a job in UX design. 

                I look up to the likes of David Carson, IDN magazine, Grace Owen, Hattie Stewart and Henn Kim.
