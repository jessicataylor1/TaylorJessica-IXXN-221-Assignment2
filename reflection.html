                            It had been a while since I had last so there were some things that I struggled with and needed a refresher 
                            for. The positioning of the photos is what I found the hardest and resizing them to be what they were on the 
                            example website. As you can see in the second photo, all the images are on top of each other and take up the 
                            whole screen. I was able to replicate the top of the landing page with minor differences in the font type. 
                            I tried to replicate the website  <a class="blog-intext-link" href="http://www.recentlyrejected.com/">Rececntly Rejected</a> Website. 
                            I worked on this for the first week of classes

                            Started to relearn Figma. I had used it last year but my knowledge was very basic. I started making 
                            my wire frames for what my blog would look like. Very low fidelity wireframes and I was still figuring 
                            out what it should look like. I also looked at what the background imagery/ colouring could possible look
                            like.  I think this design might be a bit ambitious for my skill set, more specifically for the reflection page.

                With this wireframe, I focused on simplifying the reflection page and looked more into what the background 
                would look like. I don't think I was on the right track with this one as it was maybe to low fidelity and it shouldn't include colouring just yet.

                    I had done media query's in the past but hadn't done flex box. It was easy enough to pick up though and do the

                    For assignment one, I did the brief for Calico Air. I wanted to create designs that are quite a contrast against 
                    each other but that both create a sense of wanting to travel. I tried to keep my wireframes as minimal as possible but
                    I could have gone into more detail/ shown what the website would look like if you were to scroll down. Below is what 
                    my wire frames for both designed looked like during the development process.

                    Today we were introduced to JavaScript. I had done a little in a previous course but hadn't incorporated it into HTML before.

                    images of google to recreate the movement of something turn off and on. Below is how my website looked and the code for JavaScript
                    and html . I didn't focus on styling the page as much because I put all my effort into figuring out what code was needed where 
                    and figuring out the bugs.

                    In this lesson we looked at using JavaScript to change the look of a website by using a dark and light mode button. It was a
                    little bit of a difficult class because it was online, but I got their in the end. The only big issue I had was that I had spelt
                    function wrong and I didn't notice until someone else pointed it out. If I hadn't had that issue I would have found the exercise
                    really easy. Below is what the two different modes looked like and my code at the end. Again I didn't focus on styling as much 
                    because I wanted to focus more on the technical side of the exercise.

                    After doing the wireframes for assignment one and looking more into what the wireframes should look like, I updated what my
                    blog should look like. I also did the wireframe for the mobile view as well. I included more about what the layout with text
                    and image would look like on the home page and how the mobile view could look. The mobile view could be improved as its very compact.

                    During the first week of the break, I plan to focused on making the blog post template my own and working on the lay out of the home page.
                    For the blog post template I used the css grit example as a template to follow to get the look I was after, which is shown below. 
                    I also plan on getting the navigation bar to not have a space around it, so it sat flush with the side of the screen.

                    what questions we would ask the SPCA rep, what pages we need to display and what content each needs to have. We plan to
                    regroup on Saturday with our individual user flow diagrams and then combine them together. Inserted is a photo of the flow diagram I created.

            We were introduced to Block frames which are a very basic version of wireframes and 
            prototypes where you box out elements with minimal colour and simple shapes to map out what elements you'll have where. I 
            worked on my groups brief for the first half of the lesson then went onto starting a block frame that would complete later.

                    Today we were introduced to Design systems. In this lecture we covered the aspect of visual audit, visual
                     design language and creating a UI pattern library. From there our group worked on establishing a colour palette and 
                     font face for our website and also finalising out block frames. From there we started out wireframes that we were to 
                     finish after class. Still haven't heard from one group member but we are going strong.

                <p class="blog-details">
                    Today my group went over the wire frames that were created by another group member over the weekend. We focused on details 
                    such as the curves of each buttons, which font and size would go where. This information would then help create develop our 
                    style guide more. We then divided the pages between ourselves and would create the mobile wireframe and individual style guide 
                    page for our page. In the lesson we collaborated together to create what we hope is our final wireframe to look like. We are a 
                    little behind now, but next lesson we plan to start on our prototypes. 
                    
                    Today I also worked more on my blog. I input the right text, changed to the correct font and added developed the final version 
                    of my home page. I also put in all my blog posts into the final post template as before I was writing them all out in my OneNote.

                            and have them done by Monday  so we can regroup before next class.

                            prototyping and user testing has its advantages of being tactile and easily done, it’s a very out dated use. My group 
                            collaborated on what our next step would be as we had finished out prototypes. We decided to create a questionnaire to send
                            out to our users which they would fill out while using the figma prototype. The questions cover topics such as aesthetic, usability and readability.

                     on our animal gallery page didn't make much sense, though this is down to the fact that we 
                     didn’t discuss them and it was only a place holder. We also got feedback about our spacing 
                     and positioning. In between last class and todays one, we got users to test our website and 
                     we quickly went over that feedback. I would say at the moment we are a little behind.

                    not leaving much time for our actual group work. When we did get to talk as a group, we went over the feedback and 
                    checked that we hadn't missed anything. We were missing two team members but we plan to meet before next lesson to fill 
                    them in on what we need to get done. We set up the GitHub repository and made goals for what we need to get 
                    done by next lesson. By the start of next lesson, we plan to start coding our website.

                    Today my group met before class to get our final design of our website done and make any last 
                    minute changes. This went into class time as well but we all split into groups to get things 
                    done while also making a start on the coding aspect of the website. Another group member and 
                    I started by creating the GitHub and adding everyone, setting up all the page we need and deciding 
                    to get the home page done before next lesson. At this point I would say I’m pretty stressed with only 
                    having two weeks to get this all done and the group isn’t that confident in coding, but if we 
                    split it up we should be okay.

                I also worked on updating my wireframes for my blog as my design had changed a lot since I had first started. 
                Here is the link to the <a class="blog-intext-link" href="https://www.figma.com/file/dDrIwgTWwNLrTUPDJmY9ct/Blog-wireframes-October?node-id=0%3A1">Figma </a> for it.

                   Todays lesson my group started to get the basic code for 3 pages of the website as we only had 3 people show up. 
                   I started on getting the gallery page working and looking up how to make the javascript work.
                    One person worked more on the navigation bar and another worked on the About us page.
                    We decided to use CSS flex throughout our website to make it more consistent and make it easier to code.
                    The pressure is building as we don't have much time to code this website, but many of the elements cna be repeated on other pages.
